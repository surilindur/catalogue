This repository contains an experimental tool to generate dataset summaries for data from [SolidBench](https://github.com/SolidBench/SolidBench.js). The summaries are generated by loading the data, grouping it by a key such as the URI of a pod, feeding it into a summary generator and serializing it as RDF.

The following types of summaries are possible to generate:

* [Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID)](https://www.w3.org/TR/void/) for unique predicate, subject and object counts, as well as cardinalities of predicates.
* Bloom filters to determine whether a dataset contains specific entries.

These should be possible to place at, for example, the pod root as `.meta` to add the information available at the dataset root when hosted using the [Community Solid Server](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer/).

## Running

After cloning the repository, it should be sufficient to install the dependencies:

    yarn install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-engines

The packages should be built automatically. To generate SolidBench data and VoID description:

    yarn solidbench:generate
    yarn catalogue --config ./engines/runner/config/void.json

The configurations for the summary generator are in [engines/runner/config](engines/runner/config).

## Issues

Any issues encountered can be reported via the GitHub issue tracker. However, before reporting issues, please note that this is not a production-ready application and is not intended for everyday use.
